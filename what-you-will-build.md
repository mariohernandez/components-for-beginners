# What you will build

![Homepage](.gitbook/assets/components-for-beginners.png)

The homepage design here will allow us to build a series of components following the [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/table-of-contents/) methodology.  We will start small and build from there to achie a full page.

Components provide all sorts of advantage over the traditional top-to-bottom web design/development approach, including:

* Individual attention to each piece rather than building things depending on each other
* Re-usability of previously built components
* Improved project maintenance
* Living styleguide as the single source of truth for markup, styles, and Javascript
* Improved team collaboration
* ... and more
