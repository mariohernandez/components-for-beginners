# Exercise 2.5

### Taking our new Gulp workflow for a test drive

So our gulp workflow is in place, but how do we know it works?  How about if we update the CSS files we created for the Button, Hearing and Hero components?  Great idea! 💡

1. Move `button.css`, `heading.css`, and `hero.css` from `source/css` into each of the respective components.  If you are using VS Code you can literally drag the files into each of the components.
2. Rename each CSS file in the components as `button.scss`, `heading.scss`, and `hero.scss`

Sass is a CSS Preprocessor that allows you to write Sass code and converts it to plain CSS.  This provides all kinds of advantages over plain CSS as you will see when we start writing more Sass code.  The most commonly used Sass syntax is known as “**SCSS**” \(for “Sassy **CSS**”\), and is a superset of [CSS3's syntax](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/getting-to-know-css/).  SCSS syntax is easy to learn as it most closely resembles CSS syntax.  In fact, if you noticed in step 2 above, all we did to start using SCSS was to rename files from `.css` to `.scss` and that's it, we are now using Sass. 🤯

### Running Gulp

Alright, let's run gulp for the first time and let's cross our fingers that everything works 🤞

1. While in **components\_project** in your command line tool, run

```bash
npm run gulp
```

#### Did it work?  I don't want to look 🙉 

I expect you see something like this after running gulp for the first time:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="command line" %}
```bash
> patternlab@1.0.0 gulp /Users/your-username/Sites/components_project
> gulp

[11:31:02] Using gulpfile ~/Sites/patternlab/gulpfile.js
[11:31:02] Starting 'default'...
[11:31:02] Starting 'lintSass'...
[11:31:02] Starting 'compileSass'...
[11:31:02] Finished 'compileSass' after 108 ms
[11:31:02] 

source/_patterns/00-atoms/heading/heading.scss
 12:1  ⚠  Unexpected missing end-of-source newline   no-missing-end-of-source-newline

source/_patterns/01-molecules/hero/hero.scss
 15:1  ⚠  Unexpected empty line before closing brace   block-closing-brace-empty-line-before
 20:1  ⚠  Unexpected missing end-of-source newline     no-missing-end-of-source-newline



[11:31:02] Finished 'lintSass' after 686 ms
[11:31:02] Starting 'concatCSS'...
[11:31:02] Finished 'concatCSS' after 9.27 ms
[11:31:02] Finished 'default' after 697 ms
my-MBP components_project % 
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Your output above may be different  No worries.  The point is that this worked and we're good to go 🙌

#### But does all the code above mean?

* The lines with `Starting` and `Finished` are the tasks we implemented for gulp \(compile, concatenate, lint\).
* The lines where you see a reference to a `.scss` file \(i.e. `heading.scss` or `hero.scss` \) are actually warnings generated by the linting tasks we put in place.  These messages tell you the file name, and the line number of here some issues may exist.  This is so helpful because we can go to those files and look in those line numbers and fix things accordingly.
* Notice this message above: `Unexpected missing end-of-source newline`.  Is a good practice to add an empty line at the end of most code files.
* The other issue found was `Unexpected empty line before closing brace`.  Once I fix both those issues and run `npm run gulp` again I see the following:

```bash
[11:54:06] Using gulpfile ~/Sites/patternlab/gulpfile.js
[11:54:06] Starting 'default'...
[11:54:06] Starting 'lintSass'...
[11:54:06] Starting 'compileSass'...
[11:54:06] Finished 'compileSass' after 113 ms
[11:54:06] Finished 'lintSass' after 589 ms
[11:54:06] Starting 'concatCSS'...
[11:54:07] Finished 'concatCSS' after 10 ms
[11:54:07] Finished 'default' after 601 ms
```

###  Success! 💪

**NOTE:  This was just a demo.**
