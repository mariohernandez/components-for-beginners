# Setup VS Code \(Optional\)

Most code editors provide a way to save your ongoing projects as workspaces you can quickly switch to/from.  This is not a requirement for this training but it can be handy especially as you work on multiple projects.

1. Open your text editor \(VS Code\) and click **File &gt; Open...**
2. Find the directory you created when you setup Pattern Lab \(i.e. **components\_project**\), and select it, then click the **Open** button
3. Click **File &gt; Save Workspace As...**
4. Under **Save As** change **"Untitled"** to **"components"**.  Leave the rest of the name unchanged \(**components**.code-workspace\)
5. Choose a location for your workspace.  This can be anywhere in your computer.  A good place could be "Documents' or "Desktop"**.**
6. Press the **Save** button

Now every time you start VS Code you can simply click **File &gt; Open Workspace** and choose your workspace.  Or you could also select **File &gt; Open Recent** and you should be able to see your most recent projects.
